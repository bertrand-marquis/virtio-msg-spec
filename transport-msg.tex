\section{Virtio Over Messages}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages}

The goal of the messages transport is to have commands communicated between the
frontend (driver) and backend (device) sides over a message based conduit
allowing to reach destination endpoints such as another VM, a TEE or a remote
compute engine using different communication channels.

The messages transport is designed to work efficiently between VMs on an hypervisor
based configuration or between heterogeneous systems by using messages to
reduce the number of context switches between the device and the driver sides
when each of them is in a different VM. In the same way, this is also reducing
cross system communications required in an heterogeneous system configuration.

\subsection{Messages Format}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Messages Format}

The messages have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item A message size is 40 bytes.
\item Most messages are driver/device initialisation messages.
\item Messages are expected to be sent at low frequencies and quick roundtrip is
  not necessary and should not impact global performances (as communication
  requiring performance should use virtqueues).
\end{itemize}

The virtio-MSG messages are encoded as following:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|l|X|}
\hline
Name & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
VIRTIO_MSG_TYPE & 0 & 1 & Bit[0]: 0=Request, 1=Answer \newline Bit[1]: 0=virtio-msg, 1=bus-msg \newline Bit[2-7]: Reserved \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_ID & 1 & 1 & Message ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_DEV_ID & 2 & 2 & Device ID \\
\hline
VIRTIO_MSG_PAYLOAD & 4 & 36 & Payload \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Messages Definition}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Messages Definition}

The following table is listing the different Virtio-MSG messages and the sender

\msgdef{GET_FEATURES}

The Get features message is used to retrieve 256 bits of feature information
from the device. The driver request features at an index and the device answers
with the features bits at 256*index.

TODO: How should a device signal that there are no features at the requested
 index ? is it ok to just specify that 0 will be returned in that case ? can
 we expect the driver to always know how much features a device has ?

This message is sent by the driver to the device and expects an answer from the
device.

\end{tabular}

\msgdef{SET_FEATURES}

The Set features message is used by the driver to configure the features of a
device. The driver configures 256 bits a time a given index. The device
provides in the answer the actual features value at the index after having
configured the bit requested giving an opportunity for the driver to detect if
some of the bits it tried to set were not accepted.

This message is sent by the driver to the device and expects an answer from the
device.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\

configuration values of the device. The driver can modify up to 256 bits at a
given offset in the device configuration. The device answers with the actual
configuration value at the offset after the modification to give a chance to the
driver to detect changes that have not been accepted by the device.

This message is sent by the driver to the device and expects an answer from the
device.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Request & 0 & 3 & Configuration offset \\

device.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\

Setting the virtqueue size to 0 is disabling the virtqueue without modifying
the rest of the parameters (those should be ignored by the device).
If a driver needs to complete reset a virtqueue, the RESET\_VQUEUE message
should be used instead.

This message is sent by the driver to the device and expects an answer from the
device.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\msgdef{EVENT_CONFIG}

The Event config message is sent by the device to signal to the driver that one
or several values in the device configuration have changed. The message
contains the current device status (as encoded in the GET\_DEVICE\_STATUS
answer) and optionally the part of the configuration that has been modified. If
this is not provided, the driver will have to use the GET\_CONFIG to retrieve
the configuration and discover what has changed.

This message is sent by the device to the driver and does not expect any
answer.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Type & Offset & Size (bytes) & Content \\
\hline \hline
Request & 0 & 4 & Device status \\

some data are available to process in a virtqueue. If the NOTIFICATION\_DATA
was negotiated, the message can also include more details on what is actually
available.

\subsection{Message Bus}\label{sec:Virtio Transport Options / Virtio Over Messages / Message Bus}

The Message Bus acts as a communication channel between two endpoints,
providing a standardised abstraction to exchange messages.

The Message Bus transmits the messages between the frontend and the backend in
both directions.
A system can have several Message Busses and it shall respect the following
principles:

\begin{itemize}
\item One Message Bus has a backend and a frontend side located in 2 different
      endpoints (an endpoint can be a VM, a secure Partition or a remote OS).
\item One Message Bus has one or more devices on the backend side handled by
      drivers on the frontend side.
\item An endpoint can be connected to several Message Busses.
\end{itemize}

A Message Bus implementation must provide interfaces to transmit and receive
messages from the other side.
